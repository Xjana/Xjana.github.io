        <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>
        <br>I came across a situation where I knew what I wanted to pursue, however at the time I was studying something that did not align at all with this. I weighed up at the time that I was stressed, uninterested and feeling very unfulfilled. I also weighed up what was expected of me which was study something safe and considered respectful. Then graduate and probably get a job I probably hate at 9-5 like everyone else. There was a clear path laid out for me, yet the way I wanted to go had no distinct path laid out at all. So I decided to leave studying at Massey university and begun planning out how I would create my own pathway and acquire the necessary skills to become a game designer and eventually create my own video games. </br>
        <br>Although I try to block it out, I have been reminded of the negative statistics that come with being multicultural. I have always been encouraged by my family to be the best version of myself even if it means standing out or breaking the mold. This has shaped my Identity as I’m willing to adapt and get out of my comfort zone if it means getting closer towards my purpose. This influenced my personal views as I value and respect a person's courage to improve or adapt in any areas of their lives, as I understand the process of change is very hard and often not very fun.
        </br>
        <br>I think one of my strengths is that I’m very deep thinker and am able to come up with game changing ideas. My limitations in this same regard is that I will most likely keep these ideas to myself due to fear of it getting rejected. And so in the past these ideas didn’t materialise. I’m however trying to change this, as sharing and getting feedback only adds more refinement in areas I might not have otherwise seen. Another one of my strengths is being fluid and able to compromise with others in order to reach an agreement. However this can also be my limitation in avoidance of conflict. This might intersect with learning obstacles as I will probably be tasked to cooperate with others in order to solve a complex problem.</br>
        <br>While working on a group project we were tasked to do research for a presentation on private space travel. I also asked that each member do a certain amount of work by a certain date, then we would meet and discuss. This strategy was doomed from the start as we took too long to actually start the researching stage due to disagreements on the topic. Also one of the group members did not do their share of work after being asked by all members of the group. Already short on time, I should have contacted our teacher about concerns with one of our team members not co-operating and doing enough work they were allocated. I would now do a better job at making a clearer schedule and guideline at the start of the project what was expected of everyone and by what date. I would also allocate enough time in case we were unexpectedly behind schedule to give us a cushion.
