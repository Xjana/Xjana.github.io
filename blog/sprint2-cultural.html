        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>
        <br>My strengths include being able to find and locate relationships between information or concepts and figure out how it fits together into the bigger picture. This sometimes means I forget tiny details, which could be critical. I am also a deep thinker and can generate new ideas but will often sit on these for too long and as a result wonâ€™t materialise or be shared. I also like to minimise conflict by being fluid and able to compromise. However there have been situations where avoiding conflict instead of getting to the bottom of it only causes the situation to worsen.
        </br>
        <br>I will manage my workload in this programme by using various tools to help with time management and planning such as toggl and google calendar. I will also limit as many obstacles in my control that may stop me from being able to work productively such as ensuring I take care of personal business (good sleeping patterns, diet etc). I will also not be afraid to reach out to my cohort/facilitation team for advice or constructive criticism.
        </br>
        <br>I expect the facilitation team to be a helpful guide to point us in the right direction, but still allow us to figure out and solve problems on our own. I also expect to feel confident enough to be able to go the facilitation team if I have any issues.
